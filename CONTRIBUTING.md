## 🏛️ Our Philosophy

Classic CSS is more than just a utility toolkit—it's a tribute to centuries of art, architecture, and design.  
Every contribution is a brushstroke on a living digital canvas. We value:

- **Elegance & Clarity:** Code should be readable, poetic, and maintainable.
- **Historical Inspiration:** From Renaissance to Baroque, from ancient Egypt to modern minimalism, every PR should honor style and history.
- **Performance:** Beauty and speed go hand in hand.
- **Accessibility:** True classics are for everyone.
- **Documentation:** A masterpiece is nothing without a story. Document your work!

## 👑 Contribution Guidelines

1. **Fork** this repository and create your branch from `main`.
2. **Write clear, semantic, and well-commented CSS.**  
   Use CSS Custom Properties and follow the historical theming conventions.
3. **Name classes and variables creatively, but with clarity.**  
   We love `.alert-royal`, `.badge-egyptian`, and `.card-baroque`!

  - **States:** Hover, focus, active, disabled, dark mode
  - **Animations:** Subtle, elegant, historically-inspired
